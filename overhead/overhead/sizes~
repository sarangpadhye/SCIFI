20   100000  2000

Integers above are for:
vectorlength    nreps   nsamples 

This should be adjusted as needed to get reliable timings. If clock resolution
is 0.01 seconds, you will likely need to increase nreps greatly. While developing
the code, you will probably want to reduce nsamples to 10 or 20 until the code
is debugged and you are confident it is doing the right thing.
