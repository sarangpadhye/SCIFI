						TITLE : FIND THE CLOCK RESOLUTION
						Date  : 9/4/2013
***********************************************************************************************************************
Technical specs :

- Compiler 		: GCC 4.7
- OS       		: Ubuntu 12,04 LTS
- Processor             : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU M520 @2.40GHZ 2.40GHZ
- System type           : 64-bit OS
- Amount of memory	: 4.00 GB (3.86 usable)
- Programming Language  : C Language

Objective :
===========
The objective of this assignment is to find the clock resolution of the processor. In order to find the same we are running some 
C scripts in order to perform some "N" calculations (Additions) over "M" samples with disregards to what output the program is producing.
While doing the the calculations the time before and after the calculation is measured and written to the output file.
This file is then given as an input to matlab scripts in order to calculate the Resolution of the Clock.
In this assignment I have used the timer gettimeofday() because it is more suitable for a linux based system.

Output:
========
After running the Matlab script the following results were observed.
========================================================================================================================

Read in 9999 timings from file named results
Number of timings read in: 9999
Number of nonzero timings: 9999
Finished after 43 cycles of differencing.
Likely clock resolution from file results is 2.3842e-07 seconds.
This is about 1/(4194304) seconds.

=========================================================================================================================
Issues Observed:
================
GCC Compiler could not identify CLOCK_MONOTONE and CLOCK_REALTIME when the the values were passed through clock_gettime().
